speaker="PROTEUS">And Silvia--witness Heaven, that made her fair!--</line><line act="2" scene="6" line="26" speaker="PROTEUS">Shows Julia but a swarthy Ethiope.</line><line act="2" scene="6" line="27" speaker="PROTEUS">I will forget that Julia is alive,</line><line act="2" scene="6" line="28" speaker="PROTEUS">Remembering that my love to her is dead;</line><line act="2" scene="6" line="29" speaker="PROTEUS">And Valentine I'll hold an enemy,</line><line act="2" scene="6" line="30" speaker="PROTEUS">Aiming at Silvia as a sweeter friend.</line><line act="2" scene="6" line="31" speaker="PROTEUS">I cannot now prove constant to myself,</line><line act="2" scene="6" line="32" speaker="PROTEUS">Without some treachery used to Valentine.</line><line act="2" scene="6" line="33" speaker="PROTEUS">This night he meaneth with a corded ladder</line><line act="2" scene="6" line="34" speaker="PROTEUS">To climb celestial Silvia's chamber-window,</line><line act="2" scene="6" line="35" speaker="PROTEUS">Myself in counsel, his competitor.</line><line act="2" scene="6" line="36" speaker="PROTEUS">Now presently I'll give her father notice</line><line act="2" scene="6" line="37" speaker="PROTEUS">Of their disguising and pretended flight;</line><line act="2" scene="6" line="38" speaker="PROTEUS">Who, all enraged, will banish Valentine;</line><line act="2" scene="6" line="39" speaker="PROTEUS">For Thurio, he intends, shall wed his daughter;</line><line act="2" scene="6" line="40" speaker="PROTEUS">But, Valentine being gone, I'll quickly cross</line><line act="2"

assist me;</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="2" speaker="JULIA">And even in kind love I do conjure thee,</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="3" speaker="JULIA">Who art the table wherein all my thoughts</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="4" speaker="JULIA">Are visibly character'd and engraved,</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="5" speaker="JULIA">To lesson me and tell me some good mean</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="6" speaker="JULIA">How, with my honour, I may undertake</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="7" speaker="JULIA">A journey to my loving Proteus.</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="8" speaker="LUCETTA">Alas, the way is wearisome and long!</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="9" speaker="JULIA">A true-devoted pilgrim is not weary</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="10" speaker="JULIA">To measure kingdoms with his feeble steps;</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="11" speaker="JULIA">Much less shall she that hath Love's wings to fly,</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="12" speaker="JULIA">And when the flight is made to one so dear,</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="13" speaker="JULIA">Of such divine perfection, as Sir Proteus.</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="14" speaker="LUCETTA">Better forbear till Proteus make return.</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="15" speaker="JULIA">O, know'st thou not his looks are my soul's food?</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="16" speaker="JULIA">Pity the dearth that I have pined in,</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="17" speaker="JULIA">By longing for that food so long a time.</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="18" speaker="JULIA">Didst thou but know the inly touch of love,</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="19" speaker="JULIA">Thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="20" speaker="JULIA">As seek to quench the fire of love with words.</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="21" speaker="LUCETTA">I do not seek to quench your love's hot fire,</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="22" speaker="LUCETTA">But qualify the fire's extreme rage,</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="23" speaker="LUCETTA">Lest it should burn above the bounds of reason.</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="24" speaker="JULIA">The more thou damm'st it up, the more it burns.</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="25" speaker="JULIA">The current that with gentle murmur glides,</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="26" speaker="JULIA">Thou know'st, being stopp'd, impatiently doth rage;</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="27" speaker="JULIA">But when his fair course is not hindered,</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="28" speaker="JULIA">He makes sweet music with the enamell'ed stones,</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="29" speaker="JULIA">Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="30" speaker="JULIA">He overtaketh in his pilgrimage,</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="31" speaker="JULIA">And so by many winding nooks he strays</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="32" speaker="JULIA">With willing sport to the wild ocean.</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="33" speaker="JULIA">Then let me go and hinder not my course</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="34" speaker="JULIA">I'll be as patient as a gentle stream</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="35" speaker="JULIA">And make a pastime of each weary step,</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="36" speaker="JULIA">Till the last step have brought me to my love;</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="37" speaker="JULIA">And there I'll rest, as after much turmoil</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="38" speaker="JULIA">A blessed soul doth in Elysium.</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="39" speaker="LUCETTA">But in what habit will you go along?</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="40" speaker="JULIA">Not like a woman; for I would prevent</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="41" speaker="JULIA">The loose encounters of lascivious men:</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="42" speaker="JULIA">Gentle Lucetta, fit me with such weeds</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="43" speaker="JULIA">As may beseem some well-reputed page.</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="44" speaker="LUCETTA">Why, then, your ladyship must cut your hair.</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="45" speaker="JULIA">No, girl, I'll knit it up in silken strings</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="46" speaker="JULIA">With twenty odd-conceited true-love knots.</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="47" speaker="JULIA">To be fantastic may become a youth</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="48" speaker="JULIA">Of greater time than I shall show to be.</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="49" speaker="LUCETTA">What fashion, madam shall I make your breeches?</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="50" speaker="JULIA">That fits as well as 'Tell me, good my lord,</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="51" speaker="JULIA">What compass will you wear your farthingale?'</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="52" speaker="JULIA">Why even what fashion thou best likest, Lucetta.</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="53" speaker="LUCETTA">You must needs have them with a codpiece, madam.</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="54" speaker="JULIA">Out, out, Lucetta! that would be ill-favour'd.</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="55" speaker="LUCETTA">A round hose, madam, now's not worth a pin,</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="56" speaker="LUCETTA">Unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on.</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="57" speaker="JULIA">Lucetta, as thou lovest me, let me have</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="58" speaker="JULIA">What thou thinkest meet and is most mannerly.</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="59" speaker="JULIA">But tell me, wench, how will the world repute me</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="60" speaker="JULIA">For undertaking so unstaid a journey?</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="61" speaker="JULIA">I fear me, it will make me scandalized.</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="62" speaker="LUCETTA">If you think so, then stay at home and go not.</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="63" speaker="JULIA">Nay, that I will not.</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="64" speaker="LUCETTA">Then never dream on infamy, but go.</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="65" speaker="LUCETTA">If Proteus like your journey when you come,</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="66" speaker="LUCETTA">No matter who's displeased when you are gone:</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="67" speaker="LUCETTA">I fear me, he will scarce be pleased withal.</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="68" speaker="JULIA">That is the least, Lucetta, of my fear:</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="69" speaker="JULIA">A thousand oaths, an ocean of his tears</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="70" speaker="JULIA">And instances of infinite of love</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="71" speaker="JULIA">Warrant me welcome to my Proteus.</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="72" speaker="LUCETTA">All these are servants to deceitful men.</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="73" speaker="JULIA">Base men, that use them to so base effect!</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="74" speaker="JULIA">But truer stars did govern Proteus' birth</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="75" speaker="JULIA">His words are bonds, his oaths are oracles,</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="76" speaker="JULIA">His love sincere, his thoughts immaculate,</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="77" speaker="JULIA">His tears pure messengers sent from his heart,</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="78" speaker="JULIA">His heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth.</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="79" speaker="LUCETTA">Pray heaven he prove so, when you come to him!</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="80" speaker="JULIA">Now, as thou lovest me, do him not that wrong</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="81" speaker="JULIA">To bear a hard opinion of his truth:</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="82" speaker="JULIA">Only deserve my love by loving him;</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="83" speaker="JULIA">And presently go with me to my chamber,</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="84" speaker="JULIA">To take a note of what I stand in need of,</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="85" speaker="JULIA">To furnish me upon my longing journey.</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="86" speaker="JULIA">All that is mine I leave at thy dispose,</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="87" speaker="JULIA">My goods, my lands, my reputation;</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="88" speaker="JULIA">Only, in lieu thereof, dispatch me hence.</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="89" speaker="JULIA">Come, answer not, but to it presently!</line><line act="2" scene="7" line="90" speaker="JULIA">I am impatient of my tarriance.</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="1" speaker="DUKE">Sir Thurio, give us leave, I pray, awhile;</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="2" speaker="DUKE">We have some secrets to confer about.</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="3" speaker="DUKE">Now, tell me, Proteus, what's your will with me?</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="4" speaker="PROTEUS">My gracious lord, that which I would discover</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="5" speaker="PROTEUS">The law of friendship bids me to conceal;</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="6" speaker="PROTEUS">But when I call to mind your gracious favours</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="7" speaker="PROTEUS">Done to me, undeserving as I am,</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="8" speaker="PROTEUS">My duty pricks me on to utter that</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="9" speaker="PROTEUS">Which else no worldly good should draw from me.</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="10" speaker="PROTEUS">Know, worthy prince, Sir Valentine, my friend,</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="11" speaker="PROTEUS">This night intends to steal away your daughter:</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="12" speaker="PROTEUS">Myself am one made privy to the plot.</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="13" speaker="PROTEUS">I know you have determined to bestow her</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="14" speaker="PROTEUS">On Thurio, whom your gentle daughter hates;</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="15" speaker="PROTEUS">And should she thus be stol'n away from you,</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="16" speaker="PROTEUS">It would be much vexation to your age.</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="17" speaker="PROTEUS">Thus, for my duty's sake, I rather chose</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="18" speaker="PROTEUS">To cross my friend in his intended drift</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="19" speaker="PROTEUS">Than, by concealing it, heap on your head</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="20" speaker="PROTEUS">A pack of sorrows which would press you down,</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="21" speaker="PROTEUS">Being unprevented, to your timeless grave.</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="22" speaker="DUKE">Proteus, I thank thee for thine honest care;</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="23" speaker="DUKE">Which to requite, command me while I live.</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="24" speaker="DUKE">This love of theirs myself have often seen,</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="25" speaker="DUKE">Haply when they have judged me fast asleep,</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="26" speaker="DUKE">And oftentimes have purposed to forbid</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="27" speaker="DUKE">Sir Valentine her company and my court:</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="28" speaker="DUKE">But fearing lest my jealous aim might err</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="29" speaker="DUKE">And so unworthily disgrace the man,</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="30" speaker="DUKE">A rashness that I ever yet have shunn'd,</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="31" speaker="DUKE">I gave him gentle looks, thereby to find</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="32" speaker="DUKE">That which thyself hast now disclosed to me.</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="33" speaker="DUKE">And, that thou mayst perceive my fear of this,</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="34" speaker="DUKE">Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested,</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="35" speaker="DUKE">I nightly lodge her in an upper tower,</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="36" speaker="DUKE">The key whereof myself have ever kept;</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="37" speaker="DUKE">And thence she cannot be convey'd away.</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="38" speaker="PROTEUS">Know, noble lord, they have devised a mean</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="39" speaker="PROTEUS">How he her chamber-window will ascend</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="40" speaker="PROTEUS">And with a corded ladder fetch her down;</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="41" speaker="PROTEUS">For which the youthful lover now is gone</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="42" speaker="PROTEUS">And this way comes he with it presently;</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="43" speaker="PROTEUS">Where, if it please you, you may intercept him.</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="44" speaker="PROTEUS">But, good my Lord, do it so cunningly</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="45" speaker="PROTEUS">That my discovery be not aimed at;</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="46" speaker="PROTEUS">For love of you, not hate unto my friend,</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="47" speaker="PROTEUS">Hath made me publisher of this pretence.</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="48" speaker="DUKE">Upon mine honour, he shall never know</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="49" speaker="DUKE">That I had any light from thee of this.</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="50" speaker="PROTEUS">Adieu, my Lord; Sir Valentine is coming.</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="51" speaker="DUKE">Sir Valentine, whither away so fast?</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="52" speaker="VALENTINE">Please it your grace, there is a messenger</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="53" speaker="VALENTINE">That stays to bear my letters to my friends,</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="54" speaker="VALENTINE">And I am going to deliver them.</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="55" speaker="DUKE">Be they of much import?</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="56" speaker="VALENTINE">The tenor of them doth but signify</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="57" speaker="VALENTINE">My health and happy being at your court.</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="58" speaker="DUKE">Nay then, no matter; stay with me awhile;</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="59" speaker="DUKE">I am to break with thee of some affairs</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="60" speaker="DUKE">That touch me near, wherein thou must be secret.</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="61" speaker="DUKE">'Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="62" speaker="DUKE">To match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter.</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="63" speaker="VALENTINE">I know it well, my Lord; and, sure, the match</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="64" speaker="VALENTINE">Were rich and honourable; besides, the gentleman</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="65" speaker="VALENTINE">Is full of virtue, bounty, worth and qualities</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="66" speaker="VALENTINE">Beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter:</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="67" speaker="VALENTINE">Cannot your Grace win her to fancy him?</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="68" speaker="DUKE">No, trust me; she is peevish, sullen, froward,</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="69" speaker="DUKE">Proud, disobedient, stubborn, lacking duty,</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="70" speaker="DUKE">Neither regarding that she is my child</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="71" speaker="DUKE">Nor fearing me as if I were her father;</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="72" speaker="DUKE">And, may I say to thee, this pride of hers,</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="73" speaker="DUKE">Upon advice, hath drawn my love from her;</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="74" speaker="DUKE">And, where I thought the remnant of mine age</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="75" speaker="DUKE">Should have been cherish'd by her child-like duty,</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="76" speaker="DUKE">I now am full resolved to take a wife</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="77" speaker="DUKE">And turn her out to who will take her in:</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="78" speaker="DUKE">Then let her beauty be her wedding-dower;</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="79" speaker="DUKE">For me and my possessions she esteems not.</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="80" speaker="VALENTINE">What would your Grace have me to do in this?</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="81" speaker="DUKE">There is a lady in Verona here</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="82" speaker="DUKE">Whom I affect; but she is nice and coy</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="83" speaker="DUKE">And nought esteems my aged eloquence:</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="84" speaker="DUKE">Now therefore would I have thee to my tutor--</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="85" speaker="DUKE">For long agone I have forgot to court;</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="86" speaker="DUKE">Besides, the fashion of the time is changed--</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="87" speaker="DUKE">How and which way I may bestow myself</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="88" speaker="DUKE">To be regarded in her sun-bright eye.</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="89" speaker="VALENTINE">Win her with gifts, if she respect not words:</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="90" speaker="VALENTINE">Dumb jewels often in their silent kind</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="91" speaker="VALENTINE">More than quick words do move a woman's mind.</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="92" speaker="DUKE">But she did scorn a present that I sent her.</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="93" speaker="VALENTINE">A woman sometimes scorns what best contents her.</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="94" speaker="VALENTINE">Send her another; never give her o'er;</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="95" speaker="VALENTINE">For scorn at first makes after-love the more.</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="96" speaker="VALENTINE">If she do frown, 'tis not in hate of you,</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="97" speaker="VALENTINE">But rather to beget more love in you:</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="98" speaker="VALENTINE">If she do chide, 'tis not to have you gone;</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="99" speaker="VALENTINE">For why, the fools are mad, if left alone.</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="100" speaker="VALENTINE">Take no repulse, whatever she doth say;</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="101" speaker="VALENTINE">For 'get you gone,' she doth not mean 'away!'</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="102" speaker="VALENTINE">Flatter and praise, commend, extol their graces;</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="103" speaker="VALENTINE">Though ne'er so black, say they have angels' faces.</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="104" speaker="VALENTINE">That man that hath a tongue, I say, is no man,</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="105" speaker="VALENTINE">If with his tongue he cannot win a woman.</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="106" speaker="DUKE">But she I mean is promised by her friends</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="107" speaker="DUKE">Unto a youthful gentleman of worth,</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="108" speaker="DUKE">And kept severely from resort of men,</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="109" speaker="DUKE">That no man hath access by day to her.</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="110" speaker="VALENTINE">Why, then, I would resort to her by night.</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="111" speaker="DUKE">Ay, but the doors be lock'd and keys kept safe,</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="112" speaker="DUKE">That no man hath recourse to her by night.</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="113" speaker="VALENTINE">What lets but one may enter at her window?</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="114" speaker="DUKE">Her chamber is aloft, far from the ground,</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="115" speaker="DUKE">And built so shelving that one cannot climb it</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="116" speaker="DUKE">Without apparent hazard of his life.</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="117" speaker="VALENTINE">Why then, a ladder quaintly made of cords,</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="118" speaker="VALENTINE">To cast up, with a pair of anchoring hooks,</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="119" speaker="VALENTINE">Would serve to scale another Hero's tower,</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="120" speaker="VALENTINE">So bold Leander would adventure it.</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="121" speaker="DUKE">Now, as thou art a gentleman of blood,</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="122" speaker="DUKE">Advise me where I may have such a ladder.</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="123" speaker="VALENTINE">When would you use it? pray, sir, tell me that.</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="124" speaker="DUKE">This very night; for Love is like a child,</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="125" speaker="DUKE">That longs for every thing that he can come by.</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="126" speaker="VALENTINE">By seven o'clock I'll get you such a ladder.</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="127" speaker="DUKE">But, hark thee; I will go to her alone:</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="128" speaker="DUKE">How shall I best convey the ladder thither?</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="129" speaker="VALENTINE">It will be light, my lord, that you may bear it</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="130" speaker="VALENTINE">Under a cloak that is of any length.</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="131" speaker="DUKE">A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="132" speaker="VALENTINE">Ay, my good lord.</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="133" speaker="DUKE">                  Then let me see thy cloak:</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="134" speaker="DUKE">I'll get me one of such another length.</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="135" speaker="VALENTINE">Why, any cloak will serve the turn, my lord.</line><line act="3" scene="1" line="136" speaker="DUKE">How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak?</line><line act="3" scene="1"
