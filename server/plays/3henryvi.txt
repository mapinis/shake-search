scene="3" line="54" speaker="WARWICK">Unto my brother, Archbishop of York.</line><line act="4" scene="3" line="55" speaker="WARWICK">When I have fought with Pembroke and his fellows,</line><line act="4" scene="3" line="56" speaker="WARWICK">I'll follow you, and tell what answer</line><line act="4" scene="3" line="57" speaker="WARWICK">Lewis and the Lady Bona send to him.</line><line act="4" scene="3" line="58" speaker="WARWICK">Now, for a while farewell, good Duke of York.</line><line act="4" scene="3" line="59" speaker="KING EDWARD IV">What fates impose, that men must needs abide;</line><line act="4" scene="3" line="60" speaker="KING EDWARD IV">It boots not to resist both wind and tide.</line><line act="4" scene="3" line="61" speaker="OXFORD">What now remains, my lords, for us to do</line><line act="4" scene="3" line="62" speaker="OXFORD">But march to London with our soldiers?</line><line act="4" scene="3" line="63" speaker="WARWICK">Ay, that's the first thing that we have to do;</line><line act="4" scene="3" line="64" speaker="WARWICK">To free King Henry from imprisonment</line><line act="4" scene="3" line="65" speaker="WARWICK">And see him seated in the regal throne.</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="1" speaker="RIVERS">Madam, what makes you in this sudden change?</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="2" speaker="QUEEN ELIZABETH">Why brother Rivers, are you yet to learn</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="3" speaker="QUEEN ELIZABETH">What late misfortune is befall'n King Edward?</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="4" speaker="RIVERS">What! loss of some pitch'd battle against Warwick?</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="5" speaker="QUEEN ELIZABETH">No, but the loss of his own royal person.</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="6" speaker="RIVERS">Then is my sovereign slain?</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="7" speaker="QUEEN ELIZABETH">Ay, almost slain, for he is taken prisoner,</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="8" speaker="QUEEN ELIZABETH">Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="9" speaker="QUEEN ELIZABETH">Or by his foe surprised at unawares:</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="10" speaker="QUEEN ELIZABETH">And, as I further have to understand,</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="11" speaker="QUEEN ELIZABETH">Is new committed to the Bishop of York,</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="12" speaker="QUEEN ELIZABETH">Fell Warwick's brother and by that our foe.</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="13" speaker="RIVERS">These news I must confess are full of grief;</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="14" speaker="RIVERS">Yet, gracious madam, bear it as you may:</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="15" speaker="RIVERS">Warwick may lose, that now hath won the day.</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="16" speaker="QUEEN ELIZABETH">Till then fair hope must hinder life's decay.</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="17" speaker="QUEEN ELIZABETH">And I the rather wean me from despair</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="18" speaker="QUEEN ELIZABETH">For love of Edward's offspring in my womb:</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="19" speaker="QUEEN ELIZABETH">This is it that makes me bridle passion</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="20" speaker="QUEEN ELIZABETH">And bear with mildness my misfortune's cross;</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="21" speaker="QUEEN ELIZABETH">Ay, ay, for this I draw in many a tear</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="22" speaker="QUEEN ELIZABETH">And stop the rising of blood-sucking sighs,</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="23" speaker="QUEEN ELIZABETH">Lest with my sighs or tears I blast or drown</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="24" speaker="QUEEN ELIZABETH">King Edward's fruit, true heir to the English crown.</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="25" speaker="RIVERS">But, madam, where is Warwick then become?</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="26" speaker="QUEEN ELIZABETH">I am inform'd that he comes towards London,</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="27" speaker="QUEEN ELIZABETH">To set the crown once more on Henry's head:</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="28" speaker="QUEEN ELIZABETH">Guess thou the rest; King Edward's friends must down,</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="29" speaker="QUEEN ELIZABETH">But, to prevent the tyrant's violence,--</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="30" speaker="QUEEN ELIZABETH">For trust not him that hath once broken faith,--</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="31" speaker="QUEEN ELIZABETH">I'll hence forthwith unto the sanctuary,</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="32" speaker="QUEEN ELIZABETH">To save at least the heir of Edward's right:</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="33" speaker="QUEEN ELIZABETH">There shall I rest secure from force and fraud.</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="34" speaker="QUEEN ELIZABETH">Come, therefore, let us fly while we may fly:</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="35" speaker="QUEEN ELIZABETH">If Warwick take us we are sure to die.</line><line act="4" scene="5" line="1" speaker="GLOUCESTER">Now, my Lord Hastings and Sir William Stanley,</line><line act="4" scene="5" line="2" speaker="GLOUCESTER">Leave off to wonder why I drew you hither,</line><line act="4" scene="5" line="3" speaker="GLOUCESTER">Into this chiefest thicket of the park.</line><line act="4" scene="5" line="4" speaker="GLOUCESTER">Thus stands the case: you know our king, my brother,</line><line act="4" scene="5" line="5" speaker="GLOUCESTER">Is prisoner to the bishop here, at whose hands</line><line act="4" scene="5" line="6" speaker="GLOUCESTER">He hath good usage and great liberty,</line><line act="4" scene="5" line="7" speaker="GLOUCESTER">And, often but attended with weak guard,</line><line act="4" scene="5" line="8" speaker="GLOUCESTER">Comes hunting this way to disport himself.</line><line act="4" scene="5" line="9" speaker="GLOUCESTER">I have advertised him by secret means</line><line act="4" scene="5" line="10" speaker="GLOUCESTER">That if about this hour he make his way</line><line act="4" scene="5" line="11" speaker="GLOUCESTER">Under the colour of his usual game,</line><line act="4" scene="5" line="12" speaker="GLOUCESTER">He shall here find his friends with horse and men</line><line act="4" scene="5" line="13" speaker="GLOUCESTER">To set him free from his captivity.</line><line act="4" scene="5" line="14" speaker="Huntsman">This way, my lord; for this way lies the game.</line><line act="4" scene="5" line="15" speaker="KING EDWARD IV">Nay, this way, man: see where the huntsmen stand.</line><line act="4" scene="5" line="16" speaker="KING EDWARD IV">Now, brother of Gloucester, Lord Hastings, and the rest,</line><line act="4" scene="5" line="17" speaker="KING EDWARD IV">Stand you thus close, to steal the bishop's deer?</line><line act="4" scene="5" line="18" speaker="GLOUCESTER">Brother, the time and case requireth haste:</line><line act="4" scene="5" line="19" speaker="GLOUCESTER">Your horse stands ready at the park-corner.</line><line act="4" scene="5" line="20" speaker="KING EDWARD IV">But whither shall we then?</line><line act="4" scene="5" line="21" speaker="HASTINGS">To Lynn, my lord,</line><line act="4" scene="5" line="22" speaker="HASTINGS">And ship from thence to Flanders.</line><line act="4" scene="5" line="23" speaker="GLOUCESTER">Well guess'd, believe me; for that was my meaning.</line><line act="4" scene="5" line="24" speaker="KING EDWARD IV">Stanley, I will requite thy forwardness.</line><line act="4" scene="5" line="25" speaker="GLOUCESTER">But wherefore stay we? 'tis no time to talk.</line><line act="4" scene="5" line="26" speaker="KING EDWARD IV">Huntsman, what say'st thou? wilt thou go along?</line><line act="4" scene="5" line="27" speaker="Huntsman">Better do so than tarry and be hang'd.</line><line act="4" scene="5" line="28" speaker="GLOUCESTER">Come then, away; let's ha' no more ado.</line><line act="4" scene="5" line="29" speaker="KING EDWARD IV">Bishop, farewell: shield thee from Warwick's frown;</line><line act="4" scene="5" line="30" speaker="KING EDWARD IV">And pray that I may repossess the crown.</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="1" speaker="KING HENRY VI">Master lieutenant, now that God and friends</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="2" speaker="KING HENRY VI">Have shaken Edward from the regal seat,</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="3" speaker="KING HENRY VI">And turn'd my captive state to liberty,</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="4" speaker="KING HENRY VI">My fear to hope, my sorrows unto joys,</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="5" speaker="KING HENRY VI">At our enlargement what are thy due fees?</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="6" speaker="Lieutenant">Subjects may challenge nothing of their sovereigns;</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="7" speaker="Lieutenant">But if an humble prayer may prevail,</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="8" speaker="Lieutenant">I then crave pardon of your majesty.</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="9" speaker="KING HENRY VI">For what, lieutenant? for well using me?</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="10" speaker="KING HENRY VI">Nay, be thou sure I'll well requite thy kindness,</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="11" speaker="KING HENRY VI">For that it made my imprisonment a pleasure;</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="12" speaker="KING HENRY VI">Ay, such a pleasure as incaged birds</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="13" speaker="KING HENRY VI">Conceive when after many moody thoughts</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="14" speaker="KING HENRY VI">At last by notes of household harmony</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="15" speaker="KING HENRY VI">They quite forget their loss of liberty.</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="16" speaker="KING HENRY VI">But, Warwick, after God, thou set'st me free,</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="17" speaker="KING HENRY VI">And chiefly therefore I thank God and thee;</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="18" speaker="KING HENRY VI">He was the author, thou the instrument.</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="19" speaker="KING HENRY VI">Therefore, that I may conquer fortune's spite</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="20" speaker="KING HENRY VI">By living low, where fortune cannot hurt me,</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="21" speaker="KING HENRY VI">And that the people of this blessed land</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="22" speaker="KING HENRY VI">May not be punish'd with my thwarting stars,</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="23" speaker="KING HENRY VI">Warwick, although my head still wear the crown,</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="24" speaker="KING HENRY VI">I here resign my government to thee,</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="25" speaker="KING HENRY VI">For thou art fortunate in all thy deeds.</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="26" speaker="WARWICK">Your grace hath still been famed for virtuous;</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="27" speaker="WARWICK">And now may seem as wise as virtuous,</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="28" speaker="WARWICK">By spying and avoiding fortune's malice,</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="29" speaker="WARWICK">For few men rightly temper with the stars:</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="30" speaker="WARWICK">Yet in this one thing let me blame your grace,</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="31" speaker="WARWICK">For choosing me when Clarence is in place.</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="32" speaker="CLARENCE">No, Warwick, thou art worthy of the sway,</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="33" speaker="CLARENCE">To whom the heavens in thy nativity</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="34" speaker="CLARENCE">Adjudged an olive branch and laurel crown,</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="35" speaker="CLARENCE">As likely to be blest in peace and war;</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="36" speaker="CLARENCE">And therefore I yield thee my free consent.</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="37" speaker="WARWICK">And I choose Clarence only for protector.</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="38" speaker="KING HENRY VI">Warwick and Clarence give me both your hands:</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="39" speaker="KING HENRY VI">Now join your hands, and with your hands your hearts,</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="40" speaker="KING HENRY VI">That no dissension hinder government:</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="41" speaker="KING HENRY VI">I make you both protectors of this land,</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="42" speaker="KING HENRY VI">While I myself will lead a private life</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="43" speaker="KING HENRY VI">And in devotion spend my latter days,</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="44" speaker="KING HENRY VI">To sin's rebuke and my Creator's praise.</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="45" speaker="WARWICK">What answers Clarence to his sovereign's will?</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="46" speaker="CLARENCE">That he consents, if Warwick yield consent;</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="47" speaker="CLARENCE">For on thy fortune I repose myself.</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="48" speaker="WARWICK">Why, then, though loath, yet must I be content:</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="49" speaker="WARWICK">We'll yoke together, like a double shadow</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="50" speaker="WARWICK">To Henry's body, and supply his place;</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="51" speaker="WARWICK">I mean, in bearing weight of government,</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="52" speaker="WARWICK">While he enjoys the honour and his ease.</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="53" speaker="WARWICK">And, Clarence, now then it is more than needful</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="54" speaker="WARWICK">Forthwith that Edward be pronounced a traitor,</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="55" speaker="WARWICK">And all his lands and goods be confiscate.</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="56" speaker="CLARENCE">What else? and that succession be determined.</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="57" speaker="WARWICK">Ay, therein Clarence shall not want his part.</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="58" speaker="KING HENRY VI">But, with the first of all your chief affairs,</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="59" speaker="KING HENRY VI">Let me entreat, for I command no more,</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="60" speaker="KING HENRY VI">That Margaret your queen and my son Edward</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="61" speaker="KING HENRY VI">Be sent for, to return from France with speed;</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="62" speaker="KING HENRY VI">For, till I see them here, by doubtful fear</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="63" speaker="KING HENRY VI">My joy of liberty is half eclipsed.</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="64" speaker="CLARENCE">It shall be done, my sovereign, with all speed.</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="65" speaker="KING HENRY VI">My Lord of Somerset, what youth is that,</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="66" speaker="KING HENRY VI">Of whom you seem to have so tender care?</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="67" speaker="SOMERSET">My liege, it is young Henry, earl of Richmond.</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="68" speaker="KING HENRY VI">Come hither, England's hope.</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="69" speaker="KING HENRY VI">If secret powers</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="70" speaker="KING HENRY VI">Suggest but truth to my divining thoughts,</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="71" speaker="KING HENRY VI">This pretty lad will prove our country's bliss.</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="72" speaker="KING HENRY VI">His looks are full of peaceful majesty,</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="73" speaker="KING HENRY VI">His head by nature framed to wear a crown,</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="74" speaker="KING HENRY VI">His hand to wield a sceptre, and himself</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="75" speaker="KING HENRY VI">Likely in time to bless a regal throne.</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="76" speaker="KING HENRY VI">Make much of him, my lords, for this is he</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="77" speaker="KING HENRY VI">Must help you more than you are hurt by me.</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="78" speaker="WARWICK">What news, my friend?</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="79" speaker="Post">That Edward is escaped from your brother,</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="80" speaker="Post">And fled, as he hears since, to Burgundy.</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="81" speaker="WARWICK">Unsavoury news! but how made he escape?</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="82" speaker="Post">He was convey'd by Richard Duke of Gloucester</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="83" speaker="Post">And the Lord Hastings, who attended him</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="84" speaker="Post">In secret ambush on the forest side</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="85" speaker="Post">And from the bishop's huntsmen rescued him;</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="86" speaker="Post">For hunting was his daily exercise.</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="87" speaker="WARWICK">My brother was too careless of his charge.</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="88" speaker="WARWICK">But let us hence, my sovereign, to provide</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="89" speaker="WARWICK">A salve for any sore that may betide.</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="90" speaker="SOMERSET">My lord, I like not of this flight of Edward's;</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="91" speaker="SOMERSET">For doubtless Burgundy will yield him help,</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="92" speaker="SOMERSET">And we shall have more wars before 't be long.</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="93" speaker="SOMERSET">As Henry's late presaging prophecy</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="94" speaker="SOMERSET">Did glad my heart with hope of this young Richmond,</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="95" speaker="SOMERSET">So doth my heart misgive me, in these conflicts</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="96" speaker="SOMERSET">What may befall him, to his harm and ours:</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="97" speaker="SOMERSET">Therefore, Lord Oxford, to prevent the worst,</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="98" speaker="SOMERSET">Forthwith we'll send him hence to Brittany,</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="99" speaker="SOMERSET">Till storms be past of civil enmity.</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="100" speaker="OXFORD">Ay, for if Edward repossess the crown,</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="101" speaker="OXFORD">'Tis like that Richmond with the rest shall down.</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="102" speaker="SOMERSET">It shall be so; he shall to Brittany.</line><line act="4" scene="6" line="103" speaker="SOMERSET">Come, therefore, let's about it speedily.</line><line act="4" scene="7" line="1" speaker="KING EDWARD IV">Now, brother Richard, Lord Hastings, and the rest,</line><line act="4" scene="7" line="2" speaker="KING EDWARD IV">Yet thus far fortune maketh us amends,</line><line act="4" scene="7" line="3" speaker="KING EDWARD IV">And says that once more I shall interchange</line><line act="4" scene="7" line="4" speaker="KING EDWARD IV">My waned state for Henry's regal crown.</line><line act="4" scene="7" line="5" speaker="KING EDWARD IV">Well have we pass'd and now repass'd the seas</line><line act="4" scene="7" line="6" speaker="KING EDWARD IV">And brought desired help from Burgundy:</line><line act="4" scene="7" line="7" speaker="KING EDWARD IV">What then remains, we being thus arrived</line><line act="4" scene="7" line="8" speaker="KING EDWARD IV">From Ravenspurgh haven before the gates of York,</line><line act="4" scene="7" line="9" speaker="KING EDWARD IV">But that we enter, as into our dukedom?</line><line act="4" scene="7" line="10"
