act="3" scene="5" line="84" speaker="GLOUCESTER">Without control, listed to make his prey.</line><line act="3" scene="5" line="85" speaker="GLOUCESTER">Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person:</line><line act="3" scene="5" line="86" speaker="GLOUCESTER">Tell them, when that my mother went with child</line><line act="3" scene="5" line="87" speaker="GLOUCESTER">Of that unsatiate Edward, noble York</line><line act="3" scene="5" line="88" speaker="GLOUCESTER">My princely father then had wars in France</line><line act="3" scene="5" line="89" speaker="GLOUCESTER">And, by just

says he sees it not?</line><line act="3" scene="6" line="13" speaker="Scrivener">Bad is the world; and all will come to nought,</line><line act="3" scene="6" line="14" speaker="Scrivener">When such bad dealings must be seen in thought.</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="1" speaker="GLOUCESTER">How now, my lord, what say the citizens?</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="2" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Now, by the holy mother of our Lord,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="3" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">The citizens are mum and speak not a word.</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="4" speaker="GLOUCESTER">Touch'd you the bastardy of Edward's children?</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="5" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">I did; with his contract with Lady Lucy,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="6" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">And his contract by deputy in France;</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="7" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">The insatiate greediness of his desires,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="8" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">And his enforcement of the city wives;</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="9" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="10" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">As being got, your father then in France,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="11" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">His resemblance, being not like the duke;</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="12" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Withal I did infer your lineaments,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="13" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Being the right idea of your father,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="14" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Both in your form and nobleness of mind;</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="15" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Laid open all your victories in Scotland,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="16" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Your dicipline in war, wisdom in peace,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="17" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Your bounty, virtue, fair humility:</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="18" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Indeed, left nothing fitting for the purpose</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="19" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Untouch'd, or slightly handled, in discourse</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="20" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">And when mine oratory grew to an end</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="21" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">I bid them that did love their country's good</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="22" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Cry 'God save Richard, England's royal king!'</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="23" speaker="GLOUCESTER">Ah! and did they so?</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="24" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">No, so God help me, they spake not a word;</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="25" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">But, like dumb statues or breathing stones,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="26" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Gazed each on other, and look'd deadly pale.</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="27" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Which when I saw, I reprehended them;</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="28" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">And ask'd the mayor what meant this wilful silence:</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="29" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">His answer was, the people were not wont</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="30" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">To be spoke to but by the recorder.</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="31" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Then he was urged to tell my tale again,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="32" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">'Thus saith the duke, thus hath the duke inferr'd;'</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="33" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">But nothing spake in warrant from himself.</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="34" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">When he had done, some followers of mine own,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="35" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">At the lower end of the hall, hurl'd up their caps,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="36" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">And some ten voices cried 'God save King Richard!'</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="37" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">And thus I took the vantage of those few,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="38" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">'Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,' quoth I;</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="39" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">'This general applause and loving shout</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="40" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard:'</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="41" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">And even here brake off, and came away.</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="42" speaker="GLOUCESTER">What tongueless blocks were they! would not they speak?</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="43" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">No, by my troth, my lord.</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="44" speaker="GLOUCESTER">Will not the mayor then and his brethren come?</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="45" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">The mayor is here at hand: intend some fear;</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="46" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Be not you spoke with, but by mighty suit:</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="47" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">And look you get a prayer-book in your hand,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="48" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">And stand betwixt two churchmen, good my lord;</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="49" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">For on that ground I'll build a holy descant:</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="50" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">And be not easily won to our request:</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="51" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Play the maid's part, still answer nay, and take it.</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="52" speaker="GLOUCESTER">I go; and if you plead as well for them</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="53" speaker="GLOUCESTER">As I can say nay to thee for myself,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="54" speaker="GLOUCESTER">No doubt well bring it to a happy issue.</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="55" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Go, go, up to the leads; the lord mayor knocks.</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="56" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Welcome my lord; I dance attendance here;</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="57" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">I think the duke will not be spoke withal.</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="58" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Here comes his servant: how now, Catesby,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="59" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">What says he?</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="60" speaker="CATESBY">             My lord: he doth entreat your grace;</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="61" speaker="CATESBY">To visit him to-morrow or next day:</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="62" speaker="CATESBY">He is within, with two right reverend fathers,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="63" speaker="CATESBY">Divinely bent to meditation;</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="64" speaker="CATESBY">And no worldly suit would he be moved,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="65" speaker="CATESBY">To draw him from his holy exercise.</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="66" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Return, good Catesby, to thy lord again;</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="67" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Tell him, myself, the mayor and citizens,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="68" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">In deep designs and matters of great moment,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="69" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">No less importing than our general good,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="70" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Are come to have some conference with his grace.</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="71" speaker="CATESBY">I'll tell him what you say, my lord.</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="72" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Ah, ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward!</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="73" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">He is not lolling on a lewd day-bed,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="74" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">But on his knees at meditation;</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="75" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Not dallying with a brace of courtezans,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="76" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">But meditating with two deep divines;</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="77" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Not sleeping, to engross his idle body,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="78" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">But praying, to enrich his watchful soul:</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="79" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Happy were England, would this gracious prince</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="80" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Take on himself the sovereignty thereof:</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="81" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">But, sure, I fear, we shall ne'er win him to it.</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="82" speaker="Lord Mayor">Marry, God forbid his grace should say us nay!</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="83" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">I fear he will.</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="84" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">How now, Catesby, what says your lord?</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="85" speaker="CATESBY">My lord,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="86" speaker="CATESBY">He wonders to what end you have assembled</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="87" speaker="CATESBY">Such troops of citizens to speak with him,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="88" speaker="CATESBY">His grace not being warn'd thereof before:</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="89" speaker="CATESBY">My lord, he fears you mean no good to him.</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="90" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Sorry I am my noble cousin should</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="91" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Suspect me, that I mean no good to him:</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="92" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">By heaven, I come in perfect love to him;</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="93" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">And so once more return and tell his grace.</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="94" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">When holy and devout religious men</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="95" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Are at their beads, 'tis hard to draw them thence,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="96" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">So sweet is zealous contemplation.</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="97" speaker="Lord Mayor">See, where he stands between two clergymen!</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="98" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Two props of virtue for a Christian prince,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="99" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">To stay him from the fall of vanity:</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="100" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">And, see, a book of prayer in his hand,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="101" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">True ornaments to know a holy man.</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="102" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Famous Plantagenet, most gracious prince,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="103" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Lend favourable ears to our request;</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="104" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">And pardon us the interruption</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="105" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal.</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="106" speaker="GLOUCESTER">My lord, there needs no such apology:</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="107" speaker="GLOUCESTER">I rather do beseech you pardon me,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="108" speaker="GLOUCESTER">Who, earnest in the service of my God,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="109" speaker="GLOUCESTER">Neglect the visitation of my friends.</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="110" speaker="GLOUCESTER">But, leaving this, what is your grace's pleasure?</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="111" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Even that, I hope, which pleaseth God above,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="112" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">And all good men of this ungovern'd isle.</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="113" speaker="GLOUCESTER">I do suspect I have done some offence</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="114" speaker="GLOUCESTER">That seems disgracious in the city's eyes,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="115" speaker="GLOUCESTER">And that you come to reprehend my ignorance.</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="116" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">You have, my lord: would it might please your grace,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="117" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">At our entreaties, to amend that fault!</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="118" speaker="GLOUCESTER">Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="119" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Then know, it is your fault that you resign</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="120" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">The supreme seat, the throne majestical,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="121" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">The scepter'd office of your ancestors,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="122" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Your state of fortune and your due of birth,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="123" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">The lineal glory of your royal house,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="124" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">To the corruption of a blemished stock:</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="125" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Whilst, in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="126" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Which here we waken to our country's good,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="127" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">This noble isle doth want her proper limbs;</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="128" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Her face defaced with scars of infamy,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="129" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="130" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">And almost shoulder'd in the swallowing gulf</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="131" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Of blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion.</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="132" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Which to recure, we heartily solicit</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="133" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Your gracious self to take on you the charge</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="134" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">And kingly government of this your land,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="135" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Not as protector, steward, substitute,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="136" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Or lowly factor for another's gain;</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="137" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">But as successively from blood to blood,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="138" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Your right of birth, your empery, your own.</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="139" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">For this, consorted with the citizens,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="140" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Your very worshipful and loving friends,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="141" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">And by their vehement instigation,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="142" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">In this just suit come I to move your grace.</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="143" speaker="GLOUCESTER">I know not whether to depart in silence,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="144" speaker="GLOUCESTER">Or bitterly to speak in your reproof.</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="145" speaker="GLOUCESTER">Best fitteth my degree or your condition</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="146" speaker="GLOUCESTER">If not to answer, you might haply think</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="147" speaker="GLOUCESTER">Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="148" speaker="GLOUCESTER">To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="149" speaker="GLOUCESTER">Which fondly you would here impose on me;</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="150" speaker="GLOUCESTER">If to reprove you for this suit of yours,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="151" speaker="GLOUCESTER">So season'd with your faithful love to me.</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="152" speaker="GLOUCESTER">Then, on the other side, I cheque'd my friends.</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="153" speaker="GLOUCESTER">Therefore, to speak, and to avoid the first,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="154" speaker="GLOUCESTER">And then, in speaking, not to incur the last,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="155" speaker="GLOUCESTER">Definitively thus I answer you.</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="156" speaker="GLOUCESTER">Your love deserves my thanks; but my desert</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="157" speaker="GLOUCESTER">Unmeritable shuns your high request.</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="158" speaker="GLOUCESTER">First if all obstacles were cut away,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="159" speaker="GLOUCESTER">And that my path were even to the crown,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="160" speaker="GLOUCESTER">As my ripe revenue and due by birth</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="161" speaker="GLOUCESTER">Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="162" speaker="GLOUCESTER">So mighty and so many my defects,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="163" speaker="GLOUCESTER">As I had rather hide me from my greatness,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="164" speaker="GLOUCESTER">Being a bark to brook no mighty sea,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="165" speaker="GLOUCESTER">Than in my greatness covet to be hid,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="166" speaker="GLOUCESTER">And in the vapour of my glory smother'd.</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="167" speaker="GLOUCESTER">But, God be thank'd, there's no need of me,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="168" speaker="GLOUCESTER">And much I need to help you, if need were;</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="169" speaker="GLOUCESTER">The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="170" speaker="GLOUCESTER">Which, mellow'd by the stealing hours of time,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="171" speaker="GLOUCESTER">Will well become the seat of majesty,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="172" speaker="GLOUCESTER">And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="173" speaker="GLOUCESTER">On him I lay what you would lay on me,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="174" speaker="GLOUCESTER">The right and fortune of his happy stars;</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="175" speaker="GLOUCESTER">Which God defend that I should wring from him!</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="176" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">My lord, this argues conscience in your grace;</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="177" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="178" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">All circumstances well considered.</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="179" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">You say that Edward is your brother's son:</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="180" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">So say we too, but not by Edward's wife;</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="181" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">For first he was contract to Lady Lucy--</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="182" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Your mother lives a witness to that vow--</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="183" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">And afterward by substitute betroth'd</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="184" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">To Bona, sister to the King of France.</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="185" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">These both put by a poor petitioner,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="186" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">A care-crazed mother of a many children,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="187" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">A beauty-waning and distressed widow,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="188" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Even in the afternoon of her best days,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="189" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Made prize and purchase of his lustful eye,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="190" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughts</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="191" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">To base declension and loathed bigamy</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="192" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">By her, in his unlawful bed, he got</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="193" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">This Edward, whom our manners term the prince.</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="194" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">More bitterly could I expostulate,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="195" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Save that, for reverence to some alive,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="196" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">I give a sparing limit to my tongue.</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="197" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Then, good my lord, take to your royal self</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="198" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">This proffer'd benefit of dignity;</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="199" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">If non to bless us and the land withal,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="200" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="201" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">From the corruption of abusing times,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="202" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Unto a lineal true-derived course.</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="203" speaker="Lord Mayor">Do, good my lord, your citizens entreat you.</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="204" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffer'd love.</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="205" speaker="CATESBY">O, make them joyful, grant their lawful suit!</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="206" speaker="GLOUCESTER">Alas, why would you heap these cares on me?</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="207" speaker="GLOUCESTER">I am unfit for state and majesty;</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="208" speaker="GLOUCESTER">I do beseech you, take it not amiss;</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="209" speaker="GLOUCESTER">I cannot nor I will not yield to you.</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="210" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">If you refuse it,--as, in love and zeal,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="211" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Loath to depose the child, Your brother's son;</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="212" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">As well we know your tenderness of heart</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="213" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">And gentle, kind, effeminate remorse,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="214" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Which we have noted in you to your kin,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="215" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">And egally indeed to all estates,--</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="216" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Yet whether you accept our suit or no,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="217" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">Your brother's son shall never reign our king;</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="218" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">But we will plant some other in the throne,</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="219" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">To the disgrace and downfall of your house:</line><line act="3" scene="7" line="220" speaker="BUCKINGHAM">And in this resolution here we leave
