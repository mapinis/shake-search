given,</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="24" speaker="TALBOT">Like to a trusty squire did run away:</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="25" speaker="TALBOT">In which assault we lost twelve hundred men;</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="26" speaker="TALBOT">Myself and divers gentlemen beside</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="27" speaker="TALBOT">Were there surprised and taken

ought to wear</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="30" speaker="TALBOT">This ornament of knighthood, yea or no.</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="31" speaker="GLOUCESTER">To say the truth, this fact was infamous</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="32" speaker="GLOUCESTER">And ill beseeming any common man,</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="33" speaker="GLOUCESTER">Much more a knight, a captain and a leader.</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="34" speaker="TALBOT">When first this order was ordain'd, my lords,</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="35" speaker="TALBOT">Knights of the garter were of noble birth,</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="36" speaker="TALBOT">Valiant and virtuous, full of haughty courage,</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="37" speaker="TALBOT">Such as were grown to credit by the wars;</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="38" speaker="TALBOT">Not fearing death, nor shrinking for distress,</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="39" speaker="TALBOT">But always resolute in most extremes.</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="40" speaker="TALBOT">He then that is not furnish'd in this sort</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="41" speaker="TALBOT">Doth but usurp the sacred name of knight,</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="42" speaker="TALBOT">Profaning this most honourable order,</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="43" speaker="TALBOT">And should, if I were worthy to be judge,</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="44" speaker="TALBOT">Be quite degraded, like a hedge-born swain</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="45" speaker="TALBOT">That doth presume to boast of gentle blood.</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="46" speaker="KING HENRY VI">Stain to thy countrymen, thou hear'st thy doom!</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="47" speaker="KING HENRY VI">Be packing, therefore, thou that wast a knight:</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="48" speaker="KING HENRY VI">Henceforth we banish thee, on pain of death.</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="49" speaker="KING HENRY VI">And now, my lord protector, view the letter</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="50" speaker="KING HENRY VI">Sent from our uncle Duke of Burgundy.</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="51" speaker="GLOUCESTER">What means his grace, that he hath changed his style?</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="52" speaker="GLOUCESTER">No more but, plain and bluntly, 'To the king!'</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="53" speaker="GLOUCESTER">Hath he forgot he is his sovereign?</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="54" speaker="GLOUCESTER">Or doth this churlish

act="4" scene="1" line="57" speaker="GLOUCESTER">'I have, upon especial cause,</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="58" speaker="GLOUCESTER">Moved with compassion of my country's wreck,</line><line

act="4" scene="1" line="61" speaker="GLOUCESTER">Forsaken your pernicious faction</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="62" speaker="GLOUCESTER">And join'd with Charles, the rightful King of France.'</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="63" speaker="GLOUCESTER">O monstrous treachery! can this be so,</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="64" speaker="GLOUCESTER">That in alliance, amity and oaths,</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="65" speaker="GLOUCESTER">There should be found such false dissembling guile?</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="66" speaker="KING HENRY VI">What! doth my uncle Burgundy revolt?</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="67" speaker="GLOUCESTER">He doth, my lord, and is become your foe.</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="68" speaker="KING HENRY VI">Is that the worst this letter doth contain?</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="69" speaker="GLOUCESTER">It is the worst, and all, my lord, he writes.</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="70" speaker="KING HENRY VI">Why, then, Lord Talbot there shall talk with him</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="71" speaker="KING HENRY VI">And give him chastisement for this abuse.</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="72" speaker="KING HENRY VI">How say you, my lord? are you not content?</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="73" speaker="TALBOT">Content, my liege! yes, but that I am prevented,</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="74" speaker="TALBOT">I should have begg'd I might have been employ'd.</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="75" speaker="KING HENRY VI">Then gather strength and march unto him straight:</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="76" speaker="KING HENRY VI">Let him perceive how ill we brook his treason</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="77" speaker="KING HENRY VI">And what offence it is to flout his friends.</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="78" speaker="TALBOT">I go, my lord, in heart desiring still</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="79" speaker="TALBOT">You may behold confusion of your foes.</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="80" speaker="VERNON">Grant me the combat, gracious sovereign.</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="81" speaker="BASSET">And me, my lord, grant me the combat too.</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="82" speaker="YORK">This is my servant: hear him, noble prince.</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="83" speaker="SOMERSET">And this is mine: sweet Henry, favour him.</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="84" speaker="KING HENRY VI">Be patient, lords; and give them leave to speak.</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="85" speaker="KING HENRY VI">Say, gentlemen, what makes you thus exclaim?</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="86" speaker="KING HENRY VI">And wherefore crave you combat? or with whom?</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="87" speaker="VERNON">With him, my lord; for he hath done me wrong.</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="88" speaker="BASSET">And I with him; for he hath done me wrong.</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="89" speaker="KING HENRY VI">What is that wrong whereof you both complain?</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="90" speaker="KING HENRY VI">First let me know, and then I'll answer you.</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="91" speaker="BASSET">Crossing the sea from England into France,</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="92" speaker="BASSET">This fellow here, with envious carping tongue,</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="93" speaker="BASSET">Upbraided me about the rose I wear;</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="94" speaker="BASSET">Saying, the sanguine colour of the leaves</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="95" speaker="BASSET">Did represent my master's blushing cheeks,</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="96" speaker="BASSET">When stubbornly he did repugn the truth</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="97" speaker="BASSET">About a certain question in the law</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="98" speaker="BASSET">Argued betwixt the Duke of York and him;</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="99" speaker="BASSET">With other vile and ignominious terms:</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="100" speaker="BASSET">In confutation of which rude reproach</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="101" speaker="BASSET">And in defence of my lord's worthiness,</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="102" speaker="BASSET">I crave the benefit of law of arms.</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="103" speaker="VERNON">And that is my petition, noble lord:</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="104" speaker="VERNON">For though he seem with forged quaint conceit</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="105" speaker="VERNON">To set a gloss upon his bold intent,</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="106" speaker="VERNON">Yet know, my lord, I was provoked by him;</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="107" speaker="VERNON">And he first took exceptions at this badge,</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="108" speaker="VERNON">Pronouncing that the paleness of this flower</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="109" speaker="VERNON">Bewray'd the faintness of my master's heart.</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="110" speaker="YORK">Will not this malice, Somerset, be left?</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="111" speaker="SOMERSET">Your private grudge, my Lord of York, will out,</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="112" speaker="SOMERSET">Though ne'er so cunningly you smother it.</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="113" speaker="KING HENRY VI">Good Lord, what madness rules in brainsick men,</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="114" speaker="KING HENRY VI">When for so slight and frivolous a cause</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="115" speaker="KING HENRY VI">Such factious emulations shall arise!</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="116" speaker="KING HENRY VI">Good cousins both, of York and Somerset,</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="117" speaker="KING HENRY VI">Quiet yourselves, I pray, and be at peace.</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="118" speaker="YORK">Let this dissension first be tried by fight,</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="119" speaker="YORK">And then your highness shall command a peace.</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="120" speaker="SOMERSET">The quarrel toucheth none but us alone;</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="121" speaker="SOMERSET">Betwixt ourselves let us decide it then.</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="122" speaker="YORK">There is my pledge; accept it, Somerset.</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="123" speaker="VERNON">Nay, let it rest where it began at first.</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="124" speaker="BASSET">Confirm it so, mine honourable lord.</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="125" speaker="GLOUCESTER">Confirm it so! Confounded be your strife!</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="126" speaker="GLOUCESTER">And perish ye, with your audacious prate!</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="127" speaker="GLOUCESTER">Presumptuous vassals, are you not ashamed</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="128" speaker="GLOUCESTER">With this immodest clamorous outrage</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="129" speaker="GLOUCESTER">To trouble and disturb the king and us?</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="130" speaker="GLOUCESTER">And you, my lords, methinks you do not well</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="131" speaker="GLOUCESTER">To bear with their perverse objections;</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="132" speaker="GLOUCESTER">Much less to take occasion from their mouths</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="133" speaker="GLOUCESTER">To raise a mutiny betwixt yourselves:</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="134" speaker="GLOUCESTER">Let me persuade you take a better course.</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="135" speaker="EXETER">It grieves his highness: good my lords, be friends.</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="136" speaker="KING HENRY VI">Come hither, you that would be combatants:</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="137" speaker="KING HENRY VI">Henceforth I charge you, as you love our favour,</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="138" speaker="KING HENRY VI">Quite to forget this quarrel and the cause.</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="139" speaker="KING HENRY VI">And you, my lords, remember where we are,</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="140" speaker="KING HENRY VI">In France, amongst a fickle wavering nation:</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="141" speaker="KING HENRY VI">If they perceive dissension in our looks</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="142" speaker="KING HENRY VI">And that within ourselves we disagree,</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="143" speaker="KING HENRY VI">How will their grudging stomachs be provoked</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="144" speaker="KING HENRY VI">To wilful disobedience, and rebel!</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="145" speaker="KING HENRY VI">Beside, what infamy will there arise,</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="146" speaker="KING HENRY VI">When foreign princes shall be certified</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="147" speaker="KING HENRY VI">That for a toy, a thing of no regard,</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="148" speaker="KING HENRY VI">King Henry's peers and chief nobility</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="149" speaker="KING HENRY VI">Destroy'd themselves, and lost the realm of France!</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="150" speaker="KING HENRY VI">O, think upon the conquest of my father,</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="151" speaker="KING HENRY VI">My tender years, and let us not forego</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="152" speaker="KING HENRY VI">That for a trifle that was bought with blood</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="153" speaker="KING HENRY VI">Let me be umpire in this doubtful strife.</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="154" speaker="KING HENRY VI">I see no reason, if I wear this rose,</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="155" speaker="KING HENRY VI">That any one should therefore be suspicious</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="156" speaker="KING HENRY VI">I more incline to Somerset than York:</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="157" speaker="KING HENRY VI">Both are my kinsmen, and I love them both:</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="158" speaker="KING HENRY VI">As well they may upbraid me with my crown,</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="159" speaker="KING HENRY VI">Because, forsooth, the king of Scots is crown'd.</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="160" speaker="KING HENRY VI">But your discretions better can persuade</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="161" speaker="KING HENRY VI">Than I am able to instruct or teach:</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="162" speaker="KING HENRY VI">And therefore, as we hither came in peace,</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="163" speaker="KING HENRY VI">So let us still continue peace and love.</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="164" speaker="KING HENRY VI">Cousin of York, we institute your grace</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="165" speaker="KING HENRY VI">To be our regent in these parts of France:</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="166" speaker="KING HENRY VI">And, good my Lord of Somerset, unite</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="167" speaker="KING HENRY VI">Your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot;</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="168" speaker="KING HENRY VI">And, like true subjects, sons of your progenitors,</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="169" speaker="KING HENRY VI">Go cheerfully together and digest.</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="170" speaker="KING HENRY VI">Your angry choler on your enemies.</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="171" speaker="KING HENRY VI">Ourself, my lord protector and the rest</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="172" speaker="KING HENRY VI">After some respite will return to Calais;</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="173" speaker="KING HENRY VI">From thence to England; where I hope ere long</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="174" speaker="KING HENRY VI">To be presented, by your victories,</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="175" speaker="KING HENRY VI">With Charles, Alencon and that traitorous rout.</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="176" speaker="WARWICK">My Lord of York, I promise you, the king</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="177" speaker="WARWICK">Prettily, methought, did play the orator.</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="178" speaker="YORK">And so he did; but yet I like it not,</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="179" speaker="YORK">In that he wears the badge of Somerset.</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="180" speaker="WARWICK">Tush, that was but his fancy, blame him not;</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="181" speaker="WARWICK">I dare presume, sweet prince, he thought no harm.</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="182" speaker="YORK">An if I wist he did,--but let it rest;</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="183" speaker="YORK">Other affairs must now be managed.</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="184" speaker="EXETER">Well didst thou, Richard, to suppress thy voice;</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="185" speaker="EXETER">For, had the passions of thy heart burst out,</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="186" speaker="EXETER">I fear we should have seen decipher'd there</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="187" speaker="EXETER">More rancorous spite, more furious raging broils,</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="188" speaker="EXETER">Than yet can be imagined or supposed.</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="189" speaker="EXETER">But howsoe'er, no simple man that sees</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="190" speaker="EXETER">This jarring discord of nobility,</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="191" speaker="EXETER">This shouldering of each other in the court,</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="192" speaker="EXETER">This factious bandying of their favourites,</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="193" speaker="EXETER">But that it doth presage some ill event.</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="194" speaker="EXETER">'Tis much when sceptres are in children's hands;</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="195" speaker="EXETER">But more when envy breeds unkind division;</line><line act="4" scene="1" line="196" speaker="EXETER">There comes the

is a king,</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="40" speaker="SUFFOLK">The King of Naples and Jerusalem;</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="41" speaker="SUFFOLK">And of such great authority in France</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="42" speaker="SUFFOLK">As his alliance will confirm our peace</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="43" speaker="SUFFOLK">And keep the Frenchmen in allegiance.</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="44" speaker="GLOUCESTER">And so the Earl of Armagnac may do,</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="45" speaker="GLOUCESTER">Because he is near kinsman unto Charles.</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="46" speaker="EXETER">Beside, his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower,</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="47" speaker="EXETER">Where Reignier sooner

be so abject, base and poor,</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="50" speaker="SUFFOLK">To choose for wealth and not for perfect love.</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="51" speaker="SUFFOLK">Henry is able to enrich his queen</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="52" speaker="SUFFOLK">And not seek a queen to make him rich:</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="53" speaker="SUFFOLK">So worthless peasants bargain for their wives,</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="54" speaker="SUFFOLK">As market-men for oxen, sheep, or horse.</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="55" speaker="SUFFOLK">Marriage is a matter of more worth</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="56" speaker="SUFFOLK">Than to be dealt in by attorneyship;</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="57" speaker="SUFFOLK">Not whom we will, but whom his grace affects,</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="58" speaker="SUFFOLK">Must be companion of his nuptial bed:</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="59" speaker="SUFFOLK">And therefore, lords, since he affects her most,</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="60" speaker="SUFFOLK">It most of all these reasons bindeth us,</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="61" speaker="SUFFOLK">In our opinions

and continual strife?</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="64" speaker="SUFFOLK">Whereas the contrary bringeth bliss,</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="65" speaker="SUFFOLK">And is a pattern of celestial peace.</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="66" speaker="SUFFOLK">Whom should we match with Henry, being a king,</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="67" speaker="SUFFOLK">But Margaret, that is daughter to a king?</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="68" speaker="SUFFOLK">Her peerless feature, joined with her birth,</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="69" speaker="SUFFOLK">Approves her fit for none but for a king:</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="70" speaker="SUFFOLK">Her valiant courage and undaunted spirit,</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="71" speaker="SUFFOLK">More than in women commonly is seen,</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="72" speaker="SUFFOLK">Will answer our hope in issue of a king;</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="73" speaker="SUFFOLK">For Henry, son unto a conqueror,</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="74" speaker="SUFFOLK">Is likely to beget more conquerors,</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="75" speaker="SUFFOLK">If with a lady of so high

through force of your report,</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="80" speaker="KING HENRY VI">My noble Lord of Suffolk, or for that</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="81" speaker="KING HENRY VI">My tender youth was never yet attaint</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="82" speaker="KING HENRY VI">With any passion of inflaming love,</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="83" speaker="KING HENRY VI">I cannot tell; but this I am assured,</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="84" speaker="KING HENRY VI">I feel such sharp dissension in my breast,</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="85" speaker="KING HENRY VI">Such fierce alarums both of hope and fear,</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="86" speaker="KING HENRY VI">As I am sick with working of my thoughts.</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="87" speaker="KING HENRY VI">Take, therefore, shipping; post, my lord, to France;</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="88" speaker="KING HENRY VI">Agree to any covenants, and procure</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="89" speaker="KING HENRY VI">That Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="90" speaker="KING HENRY VI">To cross the seas to England and be crown'd</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="91" speaker="KING HENRY VI">King Henry's faithful and anointed queen:</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="92" speaker="KING HENRY VI">For your expenses and sufficient charge,</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="93" speaker="KING HENRY VI">Among the people gather up a tenth.</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="94" speaker="KING HENRY VI">Be gone, I say; for, till you do return,</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="95" speaker="KING HENRY VI">I rest perplexed with a thousand cares.</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="96" speaker="KING HENRY VI">And you, good uncle, banish all offence:</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="97" speaker="KING HENRY VI">If you do censure me by what you were,</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="98" speaker="KING HENRY VI">Not what you are, I know it will excuse</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="99" speaker="KING HENRY VI">This sudden execution of my will.</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="100" speaker="KING HENRY VI">And so, conduct me where, from company,</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="101" speaker="KING HENRY VI">I may revolve and ruminate my grief.</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="102" speaker="GLOUCESTER">Ay, grief, I fear me, both at first and last.</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="103" speaker="SUFFOLK">Thus Suffolk hath prevail'd; and thus he goes,</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="104" speaker="SUFFOLK">As did the youthful Paris once to Greece,</line><line act="5" scene="5" line="105" speaker="SUFFOLK">With hope to find the like event in love,</line><line
