speaker="SATURNINUS">Myself hath often over-heard them say,</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="75" speaker="SATURNINUS">When I have walked like a private man,</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="76" speaker="SATURNINUS">That Lucius' banishment was wrongfully,</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="77" speaker="SATURNINUS">And they have wish'd that Lucius were their emperor.</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="78" speaker="TAMORA">Why should you fear? is not your city strong?</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="79" speaker="SATURNINUS">Ay, but the citizens favor Lucius,</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="80" speaker="SATURNINUS">And will revolt from me to succor him.</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="81" speaker="TAMORA">King, be thy thoughts imperious, like thy name.</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="82" speaker="TAMORA">Is the sun dimm'd, that gnats do fly in it?</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="83" speaker="TAMORA">The eagle suffers little birds to sing,</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="84" speaker="TAMORA">And is not careful what they mean thereby,</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="85" speaker="TAMORA">Knowing that with the shadow of his wings</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="86" speaker="TAMORA">He can at pleasure stint their melody:</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="87" speaker="TAMORA">Even so mayst thou the giddy men of Rome.</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="88" speaker="TAMORA">Then cheer thy spirit : for know, thou emperor,</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="89" speaker="TAMORA">I will enchant the old Andronicus</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="90" speaker="TAMORA">With words more sweet, and yet more dangerous,</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="91" speaker="TAMORA">Than baits to fish, or honey-stalks to sheep,</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="92" speaker="TAMORA">When as the one is wounded with the bait,</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="93" speaker="TAMORA">The other rotted with delicious feed.</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="94" speaker="SATURNINUS">But he will not entreat his son for us.</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="95" speaker="TAMORA">If Tamora entreat him, then he will:</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="96" speaker="TAMORA">For I can smooth and fill his aged ear</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="97" speaker="TAMORA">With golden promises; that, were his heart</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="98" speaker="TAMORA">Almost impregnable, his old ears deaf,</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="99" speaker="TAMORA">Yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue.</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="100" speaker="TAMORA">Go thou before, be our ambassador:</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="101" speaker="TAMORA">Say that the emperor requests a parley</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="102" speaker="TAMORA">Of warlike Lucius, and appoint the meeting</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="103" speaker="TAMORA">Even at his father's house, the old Andronicus.</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="104" speaker="SATURNINUS">AEmilius, do this message honourably:</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="105" speaker="SATURNINUS">And if he stand on hostage for his safety,</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="106" speaker="SATURNINUS">Bid him demand what pledge will please him best.</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="107" speaker="AEMILIUS">Your bidding shall I do effectually.</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="108" speaker="TAMORA">Now will I to that old Andronicus;</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="109" speaker="TAMORA">And temper him with all the art I have,</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="110" speaker="TAMORA">To pluck proud Lucius from the warlike Goths.</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="111" speaker="TAMORA">And now, sweet emperor, be blithe again,</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="112" speaker="TAMORA">And bury all thy fear in my devices.</line><line act="4" scene="4" line="113" speaker="SATURNINUS">Then go successantly, and plead to him.</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="1" speaker="LUCIUS">Approved warriors, and my faithful friends,</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="2" speaker="LUCIUS">I have received letters from great Rome,</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="3" speaker="LUCIUS">Which signify what hate they bear their emperor</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="4" speaker="LUCIUS">And how desirous of our sight they are.</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="5" speaker="LUCIUS">Therefore, great lords, be, as your titles witness,</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="6" speaker="LUCIUS">Imperious and impatient of your wrongs,</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="7" speaker="LUCIUS">And wherein Rome hath done you any scath,</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="8" speaker="LUCIUS">Let him make treble satisfaction.</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="9" speaker="First Goth">Brave slip, sprung from the great Andronicus,</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="10" speaker="First Goth">Whose name was once our terror, now our comfort;</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="11" speaker="First Goth">Whose high exploits and honourable deeds</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="12" speaker="First Goth">Ingrateful Rome requites with foul contempt,</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="13" speaker="First Goth">Be bold in us: we'll follow where thou lead'st,</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="14" speaker="First Goth">Like stinging bees in hottest summer's day</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="15" speaker="First Goth">Led by their master to the flowered fields,</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="16" speaker="First Goth">And be avenged on cursed Tamora.</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="17" speaker="All the Goths">And as he saith, so say we all with him.</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="18" speaker="LUCIUS">I humbly thank him, and I thank you all.</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="19" speaker="LUCIUS">But who comes here, led by a lusty Goth?</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="20" speaker="Second Goth">Renowned Lucius, from our troops I stray'd</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="21" speaker="Second Goth">To gaze upon a ruinous monastery;</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="22" speaker="Second Goth">And, as I earnestly did fix mine eye</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="23" speaker="Second Goth">Upon the wasted building, suddenly</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="24" speaker="Second Goth">I heard a child cry underneath a wall.</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="25" speaker="Second Goth">I made unto the noise; when soon I heard</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="26" speaker="Second Goth">The crying babe controll'd with this discourse:</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="27" speaker="Second Goth">'Peace, tawny slave, half me and half thy dam!</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="28" speaker="Second Goth">Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art,</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="29" speaker="Second Goth">Had nature lent thee but thy mother's look,</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="30" speaker="Second Goth">Villain, thou mightst have been an emperor:</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="31" speaker="Second Goth">But where the bull and cow are both milk-white,</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="32" speaker="Second Goth">They never do beget a coal-black calf.</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="33" speaker="Second Goth">Peace, villain, peace!'--even thus he rates</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="34" speaker="Second Goth">the babe,--</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="35" speaker="Second Goth">'For I must bear thee to a trusty Goth;</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="36" speaker="Second Goth">Who, when he knows thou art the empress' babe,</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="37" speaker="Second Goth">Will hold thee dearly for thy mother's sake.'</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="38" speaker="Second Goth">With this, my weapon drawn, I rush'd upon him,</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="39" speaker="Second Goth">Surprised him suddenly, and brought him hither,</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="40" speaker="Second Goth">To use as you think needful of the man.</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="41" speaker="LUCIUS">O worthy Goth, this is the incarnate devil</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="42" speaker="LUCIUS">That robb'd Andronicus of his good hand;</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="43" speaker="LUCIUS">This is the pearl that pleased your empress' eye,</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="44" speaker="LUCIUS">And here's the base fruit of his burning lust.</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="45" speaker="LUCIUS">Say, wall-eyed slave, whither wouldst thou convey</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="46" speaker="LUCIUS">This growing image of thy fiend-like face?</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="47" speaker="LUCIUS">Why dost not speak? what, deaf? not a word?</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="48" speaker="LUCIUS">A halter, soldiers! hang him on this tree.</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="49" speaker="LUCIUS">And by his side his fruit of bastardy.</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="50" speaker="AARON">Touch not the boy; he is of royal blood.</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="51" speaker="LUCIUS">Too like the sire for ever being good.</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="52" speaker="LUCIUS">First hang the child, that he may see it sprawl;</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="53" speaker="LUCIUS">A sight to vex the father's soul withal.</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="54" speaker="LUCIUS">Get me a ladder.</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="55" speaker="AARON">                  Lucius, save the child,</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="56" speaker="AARON">And bear it from me to the empress.</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="57" speaker="AARON">If thou do this, I'll show thee wondrous things,</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="58" speaker="AARON">That highly may advantage thee to hear:</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="59" speaker="AARON">If thou wilt not, befall what may befall,</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="60" speaker="AARON">I'll speak no more but 'Vengeance rot you all!'</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="61" speaker="LUCIUS">Say on: an if it please me which thou speak'st</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="62" speaker="LUCIUS">Thy child shall live, and I will see it nourish'd.</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="63" speaker="AARON">An if it please thee! why, assure thee, Lucius,</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="64" speaker="AARON">'Twill vex thy soul to hear what I shall speak;</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="65" speaker="AARON">For I must talk of murders, rapes and massacres,</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="66" speaker="AARON">Acts of black night, abominable deeds,</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="67" speaker="AARON">Complots of mischief, treason, villanies</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="68" speaker="AARON">Ruthful to hear, yet piteously perform'd:</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="69" speaker="AARON">And this shall all be buried by my death,</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="70" speaker="AARON">Unless thou swear to me my child shall live.</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="71" speaker="LUCIUS">Tell on thy mind; I say thy child shall live.</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="72" speaker="AARON">Swear that he shall, and then I will begin.</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="73" speaker="LUCIUS">Who should I swear by? thou believest no god:</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="74" speaker="LUCIUS">That granted, how canst thou believe an oath?</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="75" speaker="AARON">What if I do not? as, indeed, I do not;</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="76" speaker="AARON">Yet, for I know thou art religious</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="77" speaker="AARON">And hast a thing within thee called conscience,</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="78" speaker="AARON">With twenty popish tricks and ceremonies,</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="79" speaker="AARON">Which I have seen thee careful to observe,</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="80" speaker="AARON">Therefore I urge thy oath; for that I know</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="81" speaker="AARON">An idiot holds his bauble for a god</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="82" speaker="AARON">And keeps the oath which by that god he swears,</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="83" speaker="AARON">To that I'll urge him: therefore thou shalt vow</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="84" speaker="AARON">By that same god, what god soe'er it be,</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="85" speaker="AARON">That thou adorest and hast in reverence,</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="86" speaker="AARON">To save my boy, to nourish and bring him up;</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="87" speaker="AARON">Or else I will discover nought to thee.</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="88" speaker="LUCIUS">Even by my god I swear to thee I will.</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="89" speaker="AARON">First know thou, I begot him on the empress.</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="90" speaker="LUCIUS">O most insatiate and luxurious woman!</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="91" speaker="AARON">Tut, Lucius, this was but a deed of charity</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="92" speaker="AARON">To that which thou shalt hear of me anon.</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="93" speaker="AARON">'Twas her two sons that murder'd Bassianus;</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="94" speaker="AARON">They cut thy sister's tongue and ravish'd her</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="95" speaker="AARON">And cut her hands and trimm'd her as thou saw'st.</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="96" speaker="LUCIUS">O detestable villain! call'st thou that trimming?</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="97" speaker="AARON">Why, she was wash'd and cut and trimm'd, and 'twas</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="98" speaker="AARON">Trim sport for them that had the doing of it.</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="99" speaker="LUCIUS">O barbarous, beastly villains, like thyself!</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="100" speaker="AARON">Indeed, I was their tutor to instruct them:</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="101" speaker="AARON">That codding spirit had they from their mother,</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="102" speaker="AARON">As sure a card as ever won the set;</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="103" speaker="AARON">That bloody mind, I think, they learn'd of me,</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="104" speaker="AARON">As true a dog as ever fought at head.</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="105" speaker="AARON">Well, let my deeds be witness of my worth.</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="106" speaker="AARON">I train'd thy brethren to that guileful hole</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="107" speaker="AARON">Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay:</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="108" speaker="AARON">I wrote the letter that thy father found</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="109" speaker="AARON">And hid the gold within the letter mention'd,</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="110" speaker="AARON">Confederate with the queen and her two sons:</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="111" speaker="AARON">And what not done, that thou hast cause to rue,</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="112" speaker="AARON">Wherein I had no stroke of mischief in it?</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="113" speaker="AARON">I play'd the cheater for thy father's hand,</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="114" speaker="AARON">And, when I had it, drew myself apart</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="115" speaker="AARON">And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter:</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="116" speaker="AARON">I pry'd me through the crevice of a wall</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="117" speaker="AARON">When, for his hand, he had his two sons' heads;</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="118" speaker="AARON">Beheld his tears, and laugh'd so heartily,</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="119" speaker="AARON">That both mine eyes were rainy like to his :</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="120" speaker="AARON">And when I told the empress of this sport,</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="121" speaker="AARON">She swooned almost at my pleasing tale,</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="122" speaker="AARON">And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses.</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="123" speaker="First Goth">What, canst thou say all this, and never blush?</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="124" speaker="AARON">Ay, like a black dog, as the saying is.</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="125" speaker="LUCIUS">Art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds?</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="126" speaker="AARON">Ay, that I had not done a thousand more.</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="127" speaker="AARON">Even now I curse the day--and yet, I think,</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="128" speaker="AARON">Few come within the compass of my curse,--</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="129" speaker="AARON">Wherein I did not some notorious ill,</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="130" speaker="AARON">As kill a man, or else devise his death,</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="131" speaker="AARON">Ravish a maid, or plot the way to do it,</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="132" speaker="AARON">Accuse some innocent and forswear myself,</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="133" speaker="AARON">Set deadly enmity between two friends,</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="134" speaker="AARON">Make poor men's cattle break their necks;</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="135" speaker="AARON">Set fire on barns and hay-stacks in the night,</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="136" speaker="AARON">And bid the owners quench them with their tears.</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="137" speaker="AARON">Oft have I digg'd up dead men from their graves,</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="138" speaker="AARON">And set them upright at their dear friends' doors,</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="139" speaker="AARON">Even when their sorrows almost were forgot;</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="140" speaker="AARON">And on their skins, as on the bark of trees,</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="141" speaker="AARON">Have with my knife carved in Roman letters,</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="142" speaker="AARON">'Let not your sorrow die, though I am dead.'</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="143" speaker="AARON">Tut, I have done a thousand dreadful things</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="144" speaker="AARON">As willingly as one would kill a fly,</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="145" speaker="AARON">And nothing grieves me heartily indeed</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="146" speaker="AARON">But that I cannot do ten thousand more.</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="147" speaker="LUCIUS">Bring down the devil; for he must not die</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="148" speaker="LUCIUS">So sweet a death as hanging presently.</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="149" speaker="AARON">If there be devils, would I were a devil,</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="150" speaker="AARON">To live and burn in everlasting fire,</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="151" speaker="AARON">So I might have your company in hell,</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="152" speaker="AARON">But to torment you with my bitter tongue!</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="153" speaker="LUCIUS">Sirs, stop his mouth, and let him speak no more.</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="154" speaker="Third Goth">My lord, there is a messenger from Rome</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="155" speaker="Third Goth">Desires to be admitted to your presence.</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="156" speaker="LUCIUS">Let him come near.</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="157" speaker="LUCIUS">Welcome, AEmilius	what's the news from Rome?</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="158" speaker="AEMILIUS">Lord Lucius, and you princes of the Goths,</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="159" speaker="AEMILIUS">The Roman emperor greets you all by me;</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="160" speaker="AEMILIUS">And, for he understands you are in arms,</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="161" speaker="AEMILIUS">He craves a parley at your father's house,</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="162" speaker="AEMILIUS">Willing you to demand your hostages,</line><line act="5" scene="1" line="163" speaker="AEMILIUS">And they shall be immediately deliver'd.</line><line act="5"
